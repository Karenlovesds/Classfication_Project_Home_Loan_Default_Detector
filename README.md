# Classfication_Project_Home_Loan_Default_Detector
 **Problem:** Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Unfortunately, these individuals are sometimes targeted by **unreliable lenders**.   **Customer:** **Home Credit** is a company that provides loans to people. They use different statistical and machine learning techniques to predict whether a person will be able to repay the loan. However, they want to improve their predictions even more. So, they are asking participants in the Kaggle competition to help them analyze their data and come up with better ways to assess loan applicants. This will help Home Credit approve loans for deserving individuals and provide loan terms that set them up for success.
